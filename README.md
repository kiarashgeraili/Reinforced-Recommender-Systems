# Reinforced-Recommender-Systems

This is my graduation research project under the supervision of M.Akbari. We try to formulate a ReinforcedRecommender System by illustrating how to determine the requirements of an RL problem. Precisely, in this project:
1-We talked about the fundamentals of RL and Recommender Systems.
2-We tried to summarize the advantages of Reinforced Recommender Systems over traditional ways like Collaborative Filtering and Content Filtering.
3-We search for our formulation in some featured works in this area.
